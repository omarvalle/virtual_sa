We are creating a web based app with the following stack:

Voice Interface: Use OpenAI's voice agent framework for the real-time speech-to-speech interface. This provides low-latency voice interaction, continuous listening with configurable response triggers, and tight integration of speech-to-text and text-to-speech pipelines.

Compute Platform: AWS Bedrock AgentCore will serve as the compute and orchestration layer. It manages tool discovery, secure API and Lambda invocation, session state, identity, and monitoring, enabling scalable and robust agent execution.

Digital Canvas & Diagramming: Build a digital canvas (e.g., Excalidraw) integrated with a diagramming tool like Mermaid.js. This canvas will be used by the agent to visually draw and update architectural decisions made during the conversation.

Deployment: Once the architecture/diagram is finalized, the agent will programmatically spin up a containerized environment with Anthropic Claude code pre-installed. This container will handle the deployment of the agreed infrastructure to AWS, with users supplying their AWS and GitHub credentials securely.

Agent Workflow Outline:

The voice agent listens continuously but only responds when directly addressed.

Conversation context is maintained using AgentCoreâ€™s session and memory features.

The agent can trigger tool invocations to update the canvas visually and collect user confirmations.

After consensus, the agent triggers deployment via Claude code in the prepared container environment.

Development Priorities:

Optimize for low-latency streaming voice interactions.

Ensure robust multi-tool integration via AgentCore Gateway.

Provide a seamless user experience with real-time diagram updates reflecting conversation decisions.

Secure credential management and environment setup for AWS/GitHub during deployment phase.

lets' also create a .env for the api keys
